### Installation

Running the webserver requries nodejs and npm.
For [Mac and Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Database

To get the database working you need to create a .env file in root of the repo and add:
```sh
DB_USER = ""
DB_PASSWORD = ""
```
PM me to get the username and password

### Web Server

### Facebook event scraping (Optional)

PM me and I'll give you an access token which is also placed in the .env file

```sh

```
