					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>CyberSoc is the University of York's Cyber Security Society.</p>
					<p>
						The society was started in December 2017 by a group of computer science
						undergraduates with a passion for cyber security. If you've ever been
						curious about the secret lives of hackers, or wanted to learn about how to
						secure or exploit computers for fun and profit then CyberSoc is the place
						for you!
					</p>
					<p>
						Weâ€™re a dedicated bunch of enthusiasts and learners, with a range of fun
						activities for beginners and veterans of cyber security alike. Come along to
						one of our workshops (weekly, on Wednesdays) to learn how to properly secure
						your personal devices, disappear from the internet, or even compete in
						hacking competitions!
