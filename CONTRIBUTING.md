# Contributing to cybersoc.co.uk

Thanks for wanting to contribute to our repo! Here are some guidelines we ask you to follow:

## Issues

If you find any issues with the site, please open an [issue](https://github.com/CyberSocYork/cybersocyork.github.io/issues/new/choose). This will allow us to fix the issue as soon as possible. Please be as descriptive as possible in your issue, as this will help us to reproduce the problem.

## Changes to static pages

If there is a change you would like to see made to anything on the website, feel free to open an issue requesting this.

## Blog posts

Our preferred method of accepting blog posts is via pull request, as this allows us to have the git commit history accurately reflect the authors of posts. If you do not feel comfortable submitting a pull request, we also accept submissions by contacting committee directly and submitting the `.md` file.

### Commit guidelines

- Please give commits descriptive messages.
  - For example, if a commit adds a blog post titled `Why rust is the future of programming` , a suitable commit message would be `Added blog post "Why rust is the future of programming"`, not `Created file src/markdown-posts/rust-future.md`.
- Please do not use too many commits.
  - For example, if a blog post contains static images, these should all be added in the same commit as the post itself.

If your pull request does not meet these commit guidelines, we may ask you to amend your commit history (see [amending](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/changing-a-commit-message) and [rebasing](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-git-rebase)) before we accept it.
